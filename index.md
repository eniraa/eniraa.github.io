## Intro

Hi! I am a programmer who is currently in high school. In my free time, I enjoy programming.

I started with Python, but have gone to learn many other languages, like Rust and Ruby.

## Projects

### [Boxscript](https://github.com/eniraa/boxscript-py)

In a [Python Discord](https://discord.gg/python) weeklong Code Jam, I made a Turing-complete esolang using Python. Although the language itself is not useful, it is more of a proof of concept for using a more visual paradigm to represent control flow structures, such as conditionals and loops. The language is very minimalistic, which allowed direct code translation to other languages. As it was my first language, I did not feel that I had enough experience messing with industry-standard technologies such as LLVM, but I still learned about many things in the process, like the Shunting-Yard algorithm and why 2D languages are difficult to implement.

I am currently working on rewriting Boxscript using Rust as a learning exercise.

### [Ridge Computing](https://ridgecomputing.org)

I used nginx, Redis, and Flask to build and host a website on an AWS EC2. The [previous website](https://ridgecomputing.wordpress.com/) was not particularly visually appealing, so I set out to create my own version, which Ridge Computing decided to use. Although this website could have been a static website, I made the design choice to develop a backend as well in order to allow for more complexity in the future, like an account system, forum, or even code evaluation. These ideas were scrapped due to time constraints, but are available as options for the next generation of Ridge Computing.

### [Hanalon](https://github.com/sakura-no-hana/hanalon-bot)

Hanalon was born as a collaboration with some classmates. Common interests between us included Discord and gaming, so we chose to make a project that combined the two: a bot through which a multiplayer RPG was played. Using Discord as a platform may seem questionable, but it allows for a wider audience as well as the ability to skip creating a client entirely. Through Hanalon, I learned about procedural generation, ray-tracing, and the pain of having to deal with technical debt.

### Sayonara

Since many Discord bots could no longer play music from YouTube due to DMCA complaints, I decided to make my own bot. By using Lavalink to manage audio, I no longer had to do the difficult work of streaming audio files as opus frames, but there was still much to be desired. As a result, I learned about sockets to allow interprocess communication to wrap the Lavalink server with my own modifications. Namely, I implemented a much better way of searching for music, which accepts queries to BiliBili, NicoNico, and Soundcloud in addition to the commonly-used YouTube.

## Interests

### Code Golf

Over the summer of 2021, I started playing a lot on Codingame's [Clash of Code](https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/clashofcode). While there were contests for speed for coding something or reverse-engineering something, the contest that interested me the most was code golfing, or making code very short. While this is only practical in environments where storage is very unreasonably lacking, I found it to be fun. Through this, I have learned a bit of Ruby and Perl, both of which are very good for golfing—only behind esolangs like Pyth or J.

### Web Development

I am proficient in many technologies commonly used for web development: frameworks like Django and Flask, databases like Redis and Mongo, hosting providers like Heroku and Linode, etcetera. I often create websites for school ([example](https://eniraa.github.io/chem-site/site.html) and [another](https://eniraa.github.io/ap-physics-site/)), and have created websites for nonprofits like [Ridge Computing](https://ridgecomputing.org).

### Writing

Though most of my work is not published or shared (and will continue to be that way), I enjoy writing fiction. Just as with coding, I enjoy it as an escape from the real world—I can craft my own societies, laws, deities, languages, and more. Maybe it would be accurate to say that I enjoy worldbuilding more than the actual writing itself, but I also like crafting interesting plots. I create open worlds that I am free to explore on my own, but sometimes it's more entertaining to follow a certain character and their interactions with the world around them.
